# Project 1: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
- [Project Files](/Project%201/)

## Project Objectives

- Dog Identification: I successfully distinguished images that were of dogs from those that were not, regardless of whether the breed was classified correctly.
- Breed Classification: I accurately determined the breed of dogs in the given images.
- Model Selection: I evaluated different CNN model architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) to identify the one that best met the first two objectives.
- Time Consideration: I considered the trade-off between time resources and algorithm performance, exploring if an alternative solution could provide satisfactory results with less computational time.

## Key Tasks and Processes
- Editing check_images.py
    - I edited the program file check_images.py, where I defined undefined functions and modified the code to meet the project objectives.
- Implementation Guidance
    - I referred to guidance provided in the project workspace, including hints, example code, and Python documentation, to complete tasks like classifying images, creating labels, comparing labels, and calculating results.
- Timing and Evaluation
    - I used the Time Module to compute program runtime and evaluated the performance of three different image classification algorithms.
- Label Creation and Comparison
    - I used filenames to create pet image labels, utilized the classifier function to create classifier labels, and stored these in complex data structures (e.g., dictionaries).
- Classification as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
    - I employed a file (dognames.txt) to classify all labels as either "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" and stored these classifications.
- Calculation and Presentation of Results
    - I analyzed labels and classifications to assess the efficacy of the algorithm in classifying images and printed the results, repeating the tasks for each of the three algorithms provided.

Through this project, I engaged with complex data structures, applied various image classification algorithms, considered computational efficiency, and leveraged my Python skills to solve real-world challenges. This experience not only demonstrated my technical capabilities but also showcased my ability to interpret and apply advanced concepts in image classification and deep learning.
